## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

In this course:
- I can understand the fundamental principles behind machine learning and pattern recognition techniques
- I can identify and implement appropriate algorithms based on specific problem settings
- I can apply standard workflows to real-world tasks involving data-driven modeling
- I am able to recognize and handle overfitting/underfitting, and strike the right balance through model selection and tuning

## 📚 Course Content Overview

The course provided a comprehensive journey through both foundational and advanced concepts:

### 🔹 Machine Learning Topics
- Linear regression and classification
- Decision trees and ensemble methods
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
- Model evaluation, bias-variance tradeoff

### 🔹 Pattern Recognition Topics
- Feature extraction and feature selection
- Bayesian decision theory
- Application of classical ML models for pattern-based tasks

Each algorithm was explored through the lens of:  
> **how it works, when it works, and why it works.**
